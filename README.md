welcome to my game "Guess the Number"!
in this game, the computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess that number in as few attempts as possible.
here's how to play:
1. Start the game by running the program. It will ask you to choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. Based on your chosen difficulty, you will have a different number range to guess from:
   - Easy: 1 to 50
   - Medium: 1 to 100
   - Hard: 1 to 250
3. The computer will randomly select a number within the chosen range.
4. You will then enter your guesses one at a time.
5. After each guess, the computer will provide feedback:
   - "Too high!" if your guess is higher than the selected number.
   - "Too low!" if your guess is lower than the selected number.
   - "Correct!" if your guess matches the selected number.
6. You can then open leaderboards to see how your performance compares to other players.
8. Have fun and try to beat your previous scores!
